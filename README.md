# **Password Manager Project**

Hey!! Im Dey Codes, i hope that ur day is going well!!!! So, thats my new project, i already did a lot of versions of password managers, so i solve did it one more time to post here for u guys that need it :3 will be a little bit boring to config, because need put Email App password and create a account on CloundAMQP if you dont have one yet, and do all this configs,
but the program is working well. So if you gonna use it to help you on your accounts management, i highly recommend that u change the salt and the secret of the text Encrypor and dont forget to change the secret key from properties, also, this is a open code, so you can download it and do your changes, improve somethings, but remmember me alr :)
